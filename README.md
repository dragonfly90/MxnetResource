## mxnet initializer

Uniform	Initializes weights with random values uniformly sampled from a given range.
Normal	Initializes weights with random values sampled from a normal distribution with a mean of zero and standard deviation of sigma.
Load	Initializes variables by loading data from file or dict.
Mixed	Initialize parameters using multiple initializers.
Zero	Initializes weights to zero.
One	Initializes weights to one.
Constant	Initializes the weights to a scalar value.
Orthogonal	Initialize weight as orthogonal matrix.
Xavier	Returns an initializer performing “Xavier” initialization for weights.
MSRAPrelu	Initialize the weight according to a MSRA paper.
Bilinear	Initialize weight for upsampling layers.
FusedRNN	Initialize parameters for fused rnn layers.
